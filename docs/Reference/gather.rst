Overview
--------

Collection of functions for querying and scrapping the PDFs published by the 
Office of Archives, Statistics, and Research of the SDA (http://documents.adventistarchives.org/default.aspx). These functions are designed to work with the particular link structure and page layout of the online archive website, as it exists from 2014 to this current date. 

The particular problem these functions were designed to solve was verifying whether the PDF files I have locally matched those available on the archive website. This is used specifically in [link to notebook - part of OCR verification and correction]. The queued PDF ids can be used to download the files as well.
